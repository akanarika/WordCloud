(3, 'He was Chinese. He was beautiful. We met as students in America. One summer, while I was in Sarajevo and he was in Singapore, he sent me a STUFFED LOBSTER. He was thinking of me. How are lobsters and love connected? Nevertheless, I shared the bed with it. The lobster, I mean. And later with the man who gave it to me.'),
(4, 'To celebrate the release of my new movie Keka, my then-girlfriend and I decided to go back to where our relationship began-- New York. Unbeknownst to me, she bought a pirated copy of the film and worked for weeks to subtitle it herself. She then organized a screening in an underground theatre we used to live nearby and invited friends, family and even artists I admired but didnâ€™t really know. I was looking for something to contribute to the museum and when I came across this poster she put up promoting the screening, I just started crying. It was her surprise to me on my 23rd birthday, and the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me.'),
(5, 'A make-up present after a fight.'),
(6, 'He was 21 and I was 18. It was like a Romeo and Juliet clusterfu*k, him all back-combed like Robert Smith and me skinnier than now and with shorter skirts and higher-reaching socks. He seemed to drop out of the sky and unlock so many avenues of art and cinema for a girl from the Ghetto to explore, the most precious of which was the adventure of sexuality. He never lied about his girlfriend, but he lied about how he felt about her, and being young and stupid I believed him. The diary Iâ€™m sending you is in part responsible for this. It contains every train ticket, every gig ticket, and everypermanent mark that I felt important enough to make over those six months. We were â€žtasking buddiesâ€œ and very much more. After it exploded and six months of non-contact, I ran into him in the cinema with my new partner, and weâ€™ve been on/off since then. Iâ€™m sending you this diary because after seven years of being played with, Iâ€™m tired of being trapped into his voice and I want a shot at a love thatâ€™s not second best. This is a hopeful beginning, not a sad ending.'),
(7, 'An evening out in Brighton started with my getting a parking ticket (bad luck '),
(8, 'We bought it together in Misiones. I was suffering from the heat during that trip while she was buying Verawood junk and wicker baskets. Recently she took the fridge, the microwave, the LCD and the home theatre but she left the matÃ©. How insensitive of her!'),

Or both?Parallel lines do not meet.Iâ€™m fortunate to have Damyan and to enjoy real watermelon in summer.The illusion is gone.Parallel lines do not meet.'),
(11, 'It was love at first sight at a rock festival in July 2009. I was selling sandwiches and he liked them...A crazy love with a lot of going back and forth between Albi and Paris for one year, and then a year together in the capital. Always a crazy love.Then came the offer of a lifetime from a place 11,000 kilometres away from Paris: 14months in Indonesia. Our love lasted another eight months, but distance proved to be more powerful and in December 2011 it was all over... via Skype.What begins at a distance ends at a distance.This hockey puck was his first Christmas gift in 2009. He got it for me after a match he played. He hesitated a long time before giving it to me, thinking it was a bad gift, but I have always thought this was his most original gift ever.'),
(12, 'A 39Â° Celsius relationship which ended as a supernova and left a huge black hole... Those were difficult days - those were dangerous days.'),
(13, 'We are both astronomers. On my 26th birthday he sent me a spectrum of a star in the Orion constellation as my birthday gift. This star, named pi3, is 26 light years away from the Earth.He said: look, at the time when you were born, the light left this star, passing through the endless interstellar space, the countless dust and nebula, arriving here after a 26 light-year journey. So have you. Here you meetyour starlight, and I meet you.

(14, 'My first real love involved the most popular boy in my class. I was almost too afraid to talk to him â€“let alone look him in the eye. In our German classes in secondary school we used to sit next to eachother (nervously). He already had a girlfriend; the girl with the largest breasts in school. We bothchose the book â€˜Die Leiden des jungen Werthersâ€™ to read for school. The school library had only a fewcopies, however, so we decided to share. I read the book and Goethe convinced me to out my love toR. I scratcheda secret message in the first chapter by underlining letters in red. Would he think of connecting thedots? The message was something like: â€œI am in love with you R. If you feel the same way, meet meat the small lake in the woods on January 13. Iâ€™ll be waiting.â€ At the lake I waited and waited until Iheard a moped approaching. The feeling was mutual.During a bar fight a few months later R. was being beat up. I jumped in and joined the fight. While Iwas in bed for two months, recovering from my injuries, he took off with my best friend. I reread DieLeiden des jungen Werthers in tears. I then understood the concept of â€˜romantic loveâ€™ andrenounced it forever.'),
(15, 'My ex-girlfriend gave me this motorcycle. She hated that I rode motorcycles and even vowed that she would never ride mine. Soon after we began dating, I had an accident. I broke my leg and had to wear a cast, stay in bed, etc.One day she brought me this toy motorcycle. At first I thought it was a nice gift, but then she said: â€œBringing you this seems fitting seeing as how you are only capable of taking care of something of this size. Youâ€™ll have to get yourself a toy woman too because I seriously doubt you can handle awoman like me.â€I decided I never wanted to see or hear from her again. We havenâ€™t spoken since.'),
(16, 'When we first met, I had anxiety issues that made me bite my lips till they bled. Once, my partner gave me a bag of lollipops, each one with a note attached. Each note bore a message reminding me not to bite my lips and telling me how much he loved me.'),
(17, 'This bottle and I have been inseparable for 40 years! I was with my parents in our house at the seaside when I found it on the beach, but there was no message inside. The message came to me a bit later that same day. On that afternoon, I felt like painting the bottle, customizing it, it was a kind of a treasure of mine. I was in the office next to my father when, in spite of the background music, I overheard a conversation between him and some woman. My fatherâ€™s voice changed and, after having hung up, I could feel he was worried. At that moment, he went to see my mother, who was painting at her studio, to explain to her the phone conversation that had just taken place before my eyes. Being only five years old, I didnâ€™t understand much, I only know that my mother started crying. I was hiding myself behind an armchair and I heard them say: â€œHow can we explain to her that we adopted her and that she is our daughter, MY daughterâ€œ. Today, my parents arenâ€™t here anymore, and not a day goes by without me thinking about them. I miss them. I was a happy and fulfilled child. As a tribute to them I entrust you with this bottle, MY bottle, and its history, MY history.'),
(18, 'Of course I was in love with her. She was a teacher. I did not mind that she gave me pet names. I found that rather sweet. But when she started to offer me childrenâ€™s books with handwritten dedications, it began to dawn on me that that sort of relationship could not last.'),
(19, 'My godmother was really godly to me. I felt understood and she was generous beyond all measure. For Christmas or on a normal day, it rained her presents to me. Whatever I wished, I got. My relatives were green with envy. One day I eavesdropped while my mother was on the phone. I can only remember how puzzled I was by the term â€œanonymous alcoholicsâ€. I did not really know what that might be, so I coined my own definition without asking anybody. At some point my godmother moved to another country. She did not say goodbye to me and I have never understood why not. My mother told me that she had to abandon everything â€“ her husband, children, me - in her old life in order to start anew... Until today I have notasked what happened then. My â€œGottiâ€ is back â€“ I have met her shortly. We are still very close, I can feel that. We have not spoken about the old days. But I intend to ask her.'),
(20, 'We played basketball together. He was straight; I wasnâ€™t. He used to tell me about the girls he was seeing, and it killed me inside.'),
(21, 'When I was a child, we used to have a â€˜specialâ€™ hairdryer. Once switched off, it sometimes took awhile before it could be used again as it somehow overheated. We tended not to switch it offwhenever several family members needed the hairdryer one after the other. During the relationshipwith my ex-boyfriend he often used the hairdryer before me since, most of the time, he took ashower first. Although it was not the same hairdryer, I often asked if he could check whether I wasready to dry my hair and hand the running hairdryer over to me... He almost never did, but turnedthe hairdryer off instead.');
